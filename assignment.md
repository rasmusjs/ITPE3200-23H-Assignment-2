**Project assignment for ITPE3200 Web Applications Part 1, 2023**

**Project**
-----------

The project consists of an application and a short documentation.

**An application** must be implemented (including the front-end and back-end) using the Model-View-Controller framework
of .NET for one of three tasks:

* A house renting system
    * where you can let visitors rent their houses (similar to airbnb).
* A discussion forum
    * where you let visitors ask questions and answer them (similar to our discussions)
* A learning app for making flashcards
    * A solution where you can make word flashcards for learning e.g., languages, record the words in original language
      and English (or Norwegian)

In addition, **a short documentation** of 1000-3000 words (in English) must be written, which preferably includes some
diagrams, e.g., UML.

**Groups**
----------

The task must be solved in groups with 3-5 students in each group. The solution must be delivered in **Inspera** as a
group submission.

If you want to work in a group not with 3-5 students, additional information is provided
in [FAQ](https://oslomet.instructure.com/courses/26679/pages/faq-about-examination "FAQ about Examination").

**Requirements**
----------------

* Create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) solution of one of the tasks described earlier.
    * An MVP solution is a "proof of concept" solution that shows that the application's functionality is technically
      possible. Solution may experience some small bugs if it is used in slightly unexpected ways, or have a slightly
      weak UX, etc.
* The solution must be created in .NET Core (6.0 or later) with the Model-View-Controller framework* Demonstrate
                                                                                                     understanding of
                                                                                                     .NET Core and
                                                                                                     Entity Framework.

### **Basic requirements:**

* The application should not crash.
* The application must have a front-end user interface with interactive form in the form of a web page.
* CRUD **must** be supported in the task for at least one entity in the task.
* A documentation that explains the project.

### **Additional requirements:**

* User experience:
    * Basic design, not plain text and bare buttons
    * Dynamic content
    * Friendly navigation
* Coding style and documentation:
    * Neat code, structured, and modularised
    * Understandable code, either self-explanatory or with suitable comments (in English)
    * Good documentation (in the short documentation) that clarifies project architecture, functionality and how they
      are coded.
* Functionality
    * Database operation with more than 1 type of entity (including views and CRUD)
    * Repository pattern and DAL
    * Asynchronous database access
    * Forms and input validation (server-side)
    * Error handling and logging (server-side)
    * Authentication and authorisation (server-side)

**Important Notice:**
---------------------

* The solution should be implemented in .NET Core with the Model-View-Controller framework. This means that advanced
  SPA (single page application) functionality is not required (It will be required in Group Project 2).
* It is allowed to take code snippets and get inspiration from other solutions, but in order for this not to count as
  plagiarism, this must be documented.
* Grading guidelines follow the University
  Council's [grading guidelines Links to an external site.](https://student.oslomet.no/en/examination-grading-system).
* If the program is buggy, or has warnings, it will negatively affect the grades.
* If the requirements are finished in a low quality, or incomplete (e.g., for the requirement error handling and
  logging, if only part of the code is covered by error handling and logging), it will negatively affect the grades.
* In addition, it will be taken into account in the evaluation if you have beautiful design, extra rich user experience,
  and extra functionality (be creative).
* The solution must allow the examiner(s) to access it.

*
    * Either the solution allows the users to register, or the login information for users must be provided in the
      documentation.
* The assignment counts for 50% of the total. The assignments will be graded, and the final grade will be an average of
  the 1st and 2nd assignments.

**What must be delivered:**
---------------------------

A zip. file that contains the entire **code project** and the **documentation** in **Inspera**.
